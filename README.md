# Youtube-Download-FTP
I developed a web app that stores all of my music from different sources (Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud...) and allows me to listen to it with a web player. This script downloads music from all the input Youtube playlists locally using youtube-dl, then uploads the files on a distant server using SFTP.

## Requirements : 
 * Python (3+) (https://www.python.org/)
 * youtube-dl (https://youtube-dl.org/)
 * ftplib
 * paramiko 
 
## Installation : 
 *1 Download and extract the archive in your home directory
 *2 Edit the first lines in main.py with your information
 *3 Execute main.py
